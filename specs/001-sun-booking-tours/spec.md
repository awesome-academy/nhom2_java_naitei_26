## Clarifications

### Session 2026-08-18
- Q: What payment mechanism should be used and should users manage bank accounts? → A: Use SePay Test Mode + VietQR + Webhook, and drop the User manage bank account feature entirely.
- Q: How should the system prevent overbooking when multiple users try to book the last available spots for a tour simultaneously? → A: Temporarily reserve capacity (e.g., 15 minutes) when the user initiates the SePay payment. If unpaid, release the capacity.

### Session 2026-08-21
- Q: Should Twitter be removed from the social login scope since recent code only implements Google and Facebook? → A: Yes, drop Twitter and focus on Google/Facebook.
- Q: When an Admin deletes a Category, what should happen to the Tours associated with it? → A: Soft delete the Category, keeping Tours intact.
- Q: Should the 15-minute capacity reservation limit be a strict system rule? → A: Yes, strict 15 minutes (configurable via properties).

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Authentication and Profile Management (Priority: P1)

Guests register an account to become a User. Users sign in, sign out, or authenticate using external social providers (Facebook or Google). Users can manage their user profile.

**Why this priority**: Essential foundation for personalized interactions, bookings, and payments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying a Guest can register, sign in using credentials or OAuth, update profile details, and sign out, resulting in a session state change.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Guest, **When** they provide valid registration details, **Then** an account is created and they can sign in.
2. **Given** an unauthenticated User, **When** they choose to sign in via Facebook or Google, **Then** they are authenticated and gain User privileges.
3. **Given** an authenticated User, **When** they update their profile details, **Then** the information is saved.

### User Story 2 - Tour Discovery (Priority: P1)

Guests and Users can view tours, search for specific tours, view tour reviews, and independently view information about places, food, and news.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition; users must find tours before they can book them.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing a search with specific criteria and verifying the correct tours and related reviews are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Guest or User, **When** they search for a tour by criteria, **Then** the system displays matching tours.
2. **Given** a Guest or User, **When** they request information, **Then** they can view tour reviews as well as separate information about places, food, and news.

---

### User Story 3 - Tour Booking and Payment (Priority: P1)

Users can book a tour and pay for it using SePay Test Mode via VietQR. The system receives payment confirmation automatically via Webhook. A tour can also be cancelled.

**Why this priority**: The primary revenue-generating action of the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a User selecting a tour, submitting a booking request, completing a SePay payment flow, and verifying the booking is recorded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated User, **When** they book a tour and complete payment via SePay VietQR (confirmed by Webhook), **Then** the booking is confirmed and payment is recorded.
2. **Given** a booked tour, **When** a valid cancellation is initiated, **Then** the tour booking is cancelled.

---

### User Story 4 - Community Engagement (Priority: P2)

Users manage their own reviews, create new reviews, comment on a review, comment on a comment, like reviews, and rate a tour.

**Why this priority**: Important for user engagement and building trust on the platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a User rating a tour, writing a review, and another User liking and commenting on that review.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated User, **When** they submit a review and rating for a tour, **Then** the review and rating are visible to others.
2. **Given** an existing review, **When** a User likes or comments on it, **Then** the metrics and discussion thread are updated.

---

### User Story 5 - Platform Administration (Priority: P1)

Admins manage users, tours, booking requests, user reviews, revenue, and categories.

**Why this priority**: Required for operational oversight, content moderation, and business management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by an Admin creating a new category, adding a tour to it, and managing a booking request.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Admin, **When** they manage tours or categories, **Then** the updates are immediately reflected on the platform for Guests and Users.
2. **Given** an Admin reviewing booking requests, **When** they process a request, **Then** the Booking is updated according to the Admin's authorized action.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a User attempts to pay for a tour but the SePay transaction times out? (Capacity is automatically released after a strict 15-minute limit, configurable via properties, and booking state becomes expired/failed).
- How does the system handle concurrent booking requests for a tour with limited capacity? (Capacity is temporarily reserved when SePay payment is initiated).
- What happens if a User tries to comment on a review that has just been deleted by an Admin or the author?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow Guests to register a new account.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow Users to sign in using standard credentials or authenticate via Facebook or Google.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow Users to sign out.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow Users to manage their profile.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow Guests and Users to view tours, search tours, view tour reviews, and view information about places, food, and news as separate content entities.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow Users to book a tour.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow Users to pay for a tour exclusively via SePay Test Mode + VietQR + Webhook.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow both Admins and Users to cancel a booked tour.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow Users to create new reviews, manage their own reviews, comment on reviews, comment on comments, like reviews, and rate tours.
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow Admins to manage Users, Tours, booking requests, user reviews, revenue, and categories.
- **FR-011**: System MUST soft-delete a Category when an Admin deletes it, keeping associated Tours intact.

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a registered individual (Guest becomes a User). Contains profile details.
- **Tour**: The core offering that can be viewed, searched, booked, and rated.
- **Category**: A classification for Tours.
- **Booking Request**: A business capability represented through the Booking workflow. It does not require a separate persistence entity.
- **Payment**: Represents the SePay transaction for a Booking (initiated via VietQR and confirmed via Webhook).
- **Review**: Content and rating generated by Users exclusively tied to their Tour Bookings.
- **Place, Food, News**: Separate read-only content entities that Users and Guests can view.
- **Comment**: Responses attached to Reviews or other Comments.
- **Rating**: A quantitative evaluation of a tour represented by the `review.rating` field in the approved baseline database.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Guests can successfully register and Users can authenticate via all supported methods (Standard, Facebook, Google).
- **SC-002**: Users can complete a tour booking and SePay payment flow without encountering blocking errors.
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully search for tours and view associated reviews.
- **SC-004**: Admins can successfully view and modify records for users, tours, bookings, categories, and reviews.
- **SC-005**: All role-based constraints (Guest vs. User vs. Admin) are strictly enforced across actions.

## Assumptions

- External social authentication providers (Facebook, Google) are available and function using standard integration patterns.
- Payment is exclusively handled via SePay Test Mode using VietQR. The system relies on SePay Webhooks for payment confirmation. No additional payment methods are in scope.
- Standard web application patterns apply for displaying lists (e.g., viewing tours or reviews).
- "Manage" means the authorized role can perform the operations required by that approved business capability. It must not automatically be interpreted as full Create/Read/Update/Delete unless those operations are explicitly required.
- When a User successfully completes the payment process via SePay (confirmed by Webhook), the booking and payment records are updated consistently according to the approved booking workflow.
