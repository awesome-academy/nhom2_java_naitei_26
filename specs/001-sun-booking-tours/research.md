# Research: SUN Booking Tours Architecture & Stack

## 1. Full-Stack Architecture

- **Decision**: Separated Full-Stack Web Application (React frontend, Spring Boot REST API backend).
- **Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns. The frontend and backend are independent codebases communicating exclusively via REST API.

## 2. Frontend Technology Stack

- **Decision**: React 19.2.x + Vite 8.1.x + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4.x + React Router.
- **Rationale**: Fast, modern frontend development. Node.js compatibility must align with Vite 8 requirements.
- **State Management**: Built-in React State and Context. No Redux is required.

## 3. Backend Technology Stack

- **Decision**: Java 21 (LTS) and Spring Boot 4.1.0.
- **Rationale**: Java 21 is the approved LTS Java version for this project, providing mature features and strong Spring Boot ecosystem support. Spring Boot 4.1.0 provides the required backend capabilities.

## 4. Authentication, Token Storage, and JWT Flow

- **Decision**: Stateless SUN Booking JWT + HttpOnly Secure Cookie + CSRF protection.
- **Conceptual Flow**:
  1. User authenticates.
  2. Spring Boot authenticates identity.
  3. Backend creates SUN Booking JWT.
  4. Backend sends JWT using an HttpOnly Secure cookie.
  5. Browser stores the cookie automatically.
  6. React sends API requests with credentials enabled.
  7. Browser automatically includes the authentication cookie.
  8. Backend extracts and validates JWT (using a custom `BearerTokenResolver` or equivalent cookie-aware mechanism for Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server).
  9. Spring Security enforces authorization.
- **Note**: React MUST NOT access the HttpOnly JWT directly. JWT storage is strictly via HttpOnly cookie, not localStorage.

## 5. CSRF Strategy

- **Decision**: Explicit Spring Security CSRF token mechanism.
- **Rationale**: Because authentication uses cookies, an explicit CSRF strategy is required. The frontend will read the separate CSRF token when required and send it in the appropriate request header for state-changing requests. SameSite cookie configuration will be used as defense-in-depth, not as the sole protection. Safe GET/HEAD/OPTIONS requests remain read-only.

## 6. CORS and Credentials

- **Decision**: Configured frontend origins only, with credentials.
- **Rationale**: Because React/Vite and Spring Boot run as separated applications, CORS must allow only configured frontend origins. Credentials must be permitted where required for authentication cookies. Production must not use wildcard origins for authenticated APIs. Frontend API requests requiring authentication must send credentials. Development configuration must support the Vite frontend origin and Spring Boot backend origin.

## 7. Social Authentication Flow

- **Decision**: Spring Security OAuth2 Client integration.
- **Conceptual Flow**:
  1. React redirects/initiates provider login.
  2. Spring Security OAuth2 Client performs the provider authorization flow.
  3. Backend receives the authenticated provider identity.
  4. Backend maps or creates User and SocialAccount.
  5. Backend issues the SUN Booking JWT cookie.
  6. Frontend continues using SUN Booking authentication.
- **Supported Providers**: Google, Facebook, Twitter/X. Provider access tokens will not be stored unnecessarily.

## 8. Internet Banking Decision Status

- **Decision**: Payment Method: Internet Banking. Payment Provider: TBD. Provider Integration: TBD.
- **Rationale**: The architecture must remain provider-agnostic until a real provider or explicitly approved integration strategy is selected. The internet banking provider has not yet been selected.
- **Payment Architecture (Provider-Agnostic)**:
  1. User has an eligible Booking.
  2. User initiates Internet Banking payment.
  3. Backend creates/prepares Payment.
  4. External banking/payment integration executes.
  5. Backend receives or verifies authoritative external payment result.
  6. Backend updates Payment state.
  7. Frontend retrieves and displays authoritative payment status.
- **Security**: The frontend must never be allowed to mark a payment as SUCCESS directly. The backend remains authoritative for payment state. Payment amount must be determined/validated by the backend. Booking ownership must be validated. Payment provider secrets must remain backend-only once a provider is selected. External payment results must be verified server-side. Payment processing must prevent duplicate state changes. Specific security mechanisms are deferred until the provider is selected.
- **Business Clarification**: User Bank Account Management is pending mentor confirmation. Do not store or manage user bank accounts until the requirement is confirmed. Internet Banking integration remains independent and provider-agnostic.

## 9. Database Mapping & Revenue

- **Decision**: Spring Data JPA using Hibernate. Revenue calculated dynamically.
- **Rationale**: Revenue is precisely queried by summing `amount` from `payment` where `status = 'SUCCESS'`. No separate `revenue` table is required.
